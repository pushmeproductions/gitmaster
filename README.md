# [GITMASTER](http://gitmaster.herokuapp.com)
 
"It is the year 3000. Organic lifeforms battle for freedom against their robot overlords. The Version Control wars have been
raging since before you were born. You are the last in the line of Gitmasters, and have been captured after your defeat
in the most recent Merge Conflict. 
You awaken in a cellâ€¦"
 
Gitmaster is an interactive point and click adventure game that demonstrates the havoc that can be caused by pushing straight
to master. The player must navigate through a series of different locations, collecting items and using them to solve small
puzzles to win. The aim of the game is to blow up the React Core and exit the base in the Escape Pod.
